# CFoS: VR Widgets for Supershape Exploration and Selection

This app was designed for user testing nine diferent interfaces in the context of a Master Thesis by Francisco Nicolau.

### Note:
[Shapes Addon](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/shapes-173167) is required to edit project. Add it to "CFoS\CFoS Project\Assets\Tools".

## Description
Supershapes are the geometric shapes generated from sampling the [Superformula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superformula).
This formula is capable of describing curves and surfaces commonly found in the natural world (Seeds, seashells, flowers, starfish etc) and thus can be a very useful primitive for parametric modeling.

However the Superformula parameters are notably hard to intrepert as they do not have a direct and intuitive effect in the resulting shape. To adress this issue we turned to VR as a medium for developing specialized widgets. These designs make use of the extra dimension to create a more intuitive and natura interaction paradigm for exploration and selection of this parametric space.
